"""

"""
   Types of file: there are mainly two types of data types

   1) Text File --> it includes html, css, json, py, java, txt, csv, cfg, etc. files
                    it can be opened in any text editor
                    it consists of human readable characters like alphabets, numbers and symbols
                    contents in it are ususaly separated by 'space', 'comma' or 'tab'
                    it is stored in computers in terms of bytes with a convertor
                    in this, a special character in ASCII at code 26 is inserted at the end of file to signify the
                    EOF (End Of File)
                    it is of two types:
                                    --> 1) plain text file, its extension is '.txt', we can not formate it
                                    --> 2) rich text file, its extension is '.rtf', we can formate it

   2) Binary File --> it includes pdf, doc, jpg, gif, mp3, mp4, zip, mdb, iso, exe, etc. files
                      it can not be opened in any text editor, we need specific softwears to read and write it
                      it consists of non-human readable characters which require specific programs to access its contents
                      it is stored in computers in terms of bytes without any convertor
                      in this, no special character exists to signify the EOF (End Of File)
