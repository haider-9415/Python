"""
    stack --> it is a linear data structure implemented in LIFO or FILO manner where insertions and deletions of elements
              are restricted to occure only at one end called "stack's top"
              it is a dynamic data structure ,i.e., it will work if it has no element or it has many elements 

    LIFO(Last In First Out): it means that element which would be inserted in last is the first element which would be deleted
    FILO(First In Last Out): it means that element which would be inserted first is the last element which would be deleted
    E.g. --> suppose there are some plates have been placed above one another, in this case, the plate to be placed first will be taken in last and
             similarly the plate to be placed in last will be taken first

    applications of stack:
                        1) string reversal
                        2) undo or redo
                        3) forward and backward features of web browsing
                        4) parenthesis matching
                        5) polished string
                        6) memory management in modern computers
                        7) backtracking
                        8) some algorithms like tower of hanoi, tree traversals, stock span problems and histrogram problems
                        9) some games like chess, checkers and sudoku
                        10) the compilers use it during recursion
