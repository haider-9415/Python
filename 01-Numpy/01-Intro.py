"""
    It stands for Numerical Python.

    It is a library used for working with arrays.

    It also has functions for working in domain of linear aljebra, fourier transform and matrices.

    It provides array object that is up to 50x faster traditional python list.

    Most of its parts are written in C or C++

    Its codebase is --> https://github.com/numpy/numpy

    To install NumPy:
                  --> run the command in terminal: pip install numpy
    
    To use it:
           --> write the code in file: import numpy as given_name
    
    To see its version:
                    --> given_name.__version__
    
    The array object in numpy is called 'ndarray'
    

"""

import numpy as np

print('np.__version__ --> ',np.__version__ ,'\n')
